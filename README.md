**Chess with Min-Max Algorithm**
A Python-based chess game built using the Pygame library and the Min-Max algorithm for AI-based move suggestions. This project helps players make informed decisions by analyzing the opponent's possible moves and suggesting optimal next steps.

Features
Interactive chessboard with intuitive gameplay.
AI-powered move suggestions using the Min-Max algorithm.
Real-time opponent move analysis.
Guided gameplay to improve player strategy.


Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Game Engine: Pygame
Algorithm: Min-Max Algorithm

How It Works
The game simulates a standard chessboard.
Players take turns making their moves.
After each player’s move, the Min-Max algorithm evaluates the board to:
Simulate the opponent's possible moves.
Predict the best possible move for the user based on a scoring system.
The AI suggests the optimal move to help the player strategize effectively.

Installation
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AriesCasper/chess-min-max.git
cd chess-min-max

2. Install dependencies: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install Pygame:
pip install pygame

3. Run the application:
python main.py

How to Play
Launch the game by running the main.py file.
Interact with the chessboard using the mouse.
Play your turn, and observe AI move suggestions.
Follow the prompts to make your move or refine your strategy based on AI guidance.
